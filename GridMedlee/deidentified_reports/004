GI: Ms Xxxxxxxxx is an 82 y/o woman first seen by me V-01 for evaluation of fecal incontinence. She has a PMHx of HTN, Syncope. A colonoscopy done V-01 was notable for sigmoid diverticula but was otherwise WNL. She was given PRN f/u and did not return until III-05 for evaluation of symptoms of early satiety. An EGD was WNL and a gastic emptying study was c/w gastroparesis. She treated with Reglan and Zelnorm. Both agents were d/c secondary to side effects. She is now followed expectantly on no medication for this condition. At her last visit she reported the recent recurrence of symptoms of fecal incontinence. She initially responded to fiber only to return 13 Jan with the complaint of recurrence of diarrhea. It was my impression that her symptoms were secondary to diarrhea predominant IBS. Stool studies and blood work were requested and f/u given to check results. Data: B12,folate,TFT's, Celiac panel: WNL Stool studies (O&P, C&S, C.diff):Negative During her most recent visit she was started on a trial of immodium for treatment of mild IBS. A f/u appointment was given to determine the response. Meds: Prilosec Reglan Imodium PRN Today she reports satisfactory control of all her GI symptoms on her current regimen. I will cont her on hr current meds and follow her on a PRN basis. YY Yyyyyy-Yyyyyyyyyyyy
