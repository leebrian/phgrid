To whom it my concern Please note that Ms XXXXXX is 64 y/o female with h/o HTN, DM, asthma, who initially presented to our ER on 12/16/2005 with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and symptoms consistent with acute Right lower extremity (RLE) ischemia. Patient was subsequently admitted to Milstein Hospital. Thrombectomy of right femoral artery with RLE fasciotomy was performed on the same day. Afterwards the patient continued to complain of abdominal pain. A CT angio of abd/pelvis showed patent celiac/SMA with thrombus in distal thoracic aorta. Small bowel segment showed signs of inflammation. Pt was then taken to the OR on 12/16/06 where a 3 ft segment of Small Bowel appeared slightly ischemic but viable, so no further surgical intervention was deemed necessary at that time. Pt taken to OR 12/27/05 for suspected Small Bowel Obstruction and was found to have 17 ischemic area of SB that was resected. Small bowel reanastomosis & abdominal wall closure was done on 12/28.
