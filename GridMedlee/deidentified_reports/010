3/16/06 Oncology Clinic F/U 74 y old man with CAD, CHF with EF 25% who was referred to Oncology for further evaluation and management of a mass in the left hepatic lobe measuring 6 x6.6cm. The mass was first noted on CT scan in 8/05, and a CT guided biopsy was performed 10/3/05 showing an invasive malignant neoplasm, of uncertain histogenesis. He was admitted for CHF in 12/05 and a repeat biopsy was performed, showing findings suspicious for metastatic melanoma versus GIST. He was readmitted in 1/06 for CHF, and he gave permission for his biopsy to be reviewed at University of Pennsylvania by Dr. Ddddd Dddddd. Has started Gleevec for suspected GIST based on outside pathology review. Brain MRI on 2/28 showed old cerebellar infarcts which I think could be contributing to his difficulty with balance and gait. At last visit, he complained of diarrhea, which may be realated to Gleevec, and Imodium was recommended.  Today, he says he has worse dizziness than ever, which usually comes on when getting up to walk, accompanied by nausea.  He feels like the world is spending.  He has not had any fever.  He also has diarrhea, alternating with constipation.  At times he has the desire to have a bowel movement, but nothing comes out.  When he does have diarreha, it hurts his stomach.  He also complains of zero appetite.  He chews the food and spits it out.  Complains of hiccups at night. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: . CHF / DCM ? etiology --EF: 25% on Cath in 10/2002 . CAD .
