Patient Name: Xxxx Xxxxx Xxxxxx MR: 9999999 3/8/06 Rheumatology Clinic -- follow up visit PMD: Dr. Kkkkk Bbbbbbb (next visit 4/5/06) Renal: Dr. Kkkkkkkkk Dddd 64 yo M with HIV, diagnosed in 1990s (VL < 50, CD4 count 408 as of 9/14/05), CRI (baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8), HTN, hypercholesteremia, prior CVA, seen in clinic by Dr. Eeeeeeeee Mmmmm for polyarticular gouty arthritis. His first attack was about 2 years ago, in the L ankle, had X-rays and a local intra-articular injection (at an outside clinic), with subsequent resolution. He then had R knee swelling about 6 months ago, the joint was aspirated and injected (outside MD Dr. Aaaaa Fffff), again with improvement. In March 2005, he was seen in the ED with R wrist swelling and pain, synovial fluid was aspirated by the orthopedics consultant and examined under polarized light microscopy, with intracellular negatively birefringent crystals confirming the diagnosis of acute gout. He was treated with tablets, does not recall name. In May 2005, he developed pain and swelling in his R foot, then in his L foot, he was treated with a prednisone taper (10 mg bid) and colchicine 0.6 mg po daily with improvement. He was counseled about dietary modifications and avoidance of alcohol, and says he was taking daily colchicine until recently. Soon after stopping the colchicine, however, he developed pain on the lateral aspect of his L foot one week ago. Onset was insidious, there was no trauman or skin breakdown, he took no meds for this, and symptoms progressed to the point he had difficulty with weight bearing and saw Dr. Bbbbbbb on 10/17/05. On that day, I briefly saw the patient in the ED (he was escorted by Dr. Bbbbbbb), and noted soft tissue swelling, warmth and erythema over the dorsal lateral aspect of his L foot, along the 5th tarsal. The skin was intact, there was no joint deformity or other articular involvement. We presumed he was having another gout flare and began treatment with prednisone 10 mg po bid, with a plan to follow up on 10/19/05 in Rheumatology Clinic. In follow up 10/19/05, he was feeling better after 2 days of prednisone 10 mg po bid, with only mild swelling and warmth, but still exquisite tenderness to pressure lateral to the L 5th tarsal, so he was started on a taper, to 10 mg po qd x 3days, then 5 mg po daily until the next visit 10/26/05. In follow up 10/26/05, the patient reported continued gradual improvement in his pain, however he still had significant pain with weight bearing on the L foot, requiring the continued use of a cane. In follow up 11/2/05, pt reports feeling much improved, only minimal discomfort with weight bearing, no need for a cane. He has not noted any change in his bowel movements while on colchicine, does have some baseline loose BMs that have been attributed to his HIV meds. In follow up 12/7/05, pt reports complete resolution of his gouty flare, the prednisone was stopped 2 weeks ago as scheduled, and he still taking the colchicine daily. He was cleared to begin allopurinol at a low dose (50 mg daily) at his next visit with Dr. Bbbbbbb. In follow up 2/8/06, he has no joint complaints, denies increase in baseline loose BMs, denies rash since starting allopurinol. In follow up today, again denies joint pain, rash, muscle pain or weakness. Allergies: PCN, Bactrim, Sulfa Medications: combivir viracept pravachol 20mg daily Cozaar 50mg daily tylenol 325mg prn colchicine 0.6 mg po daily allopurinol 100 mg po daily On exam: well-appearing, ambulating comfortably Musculoskeletal: no synovitis, L foot soft tissue inflammation has completely resolved, motor strength 5/5 throughout Labs (2/3/06): uric acid 7.5 BUN 35/ creat 2.8 (baseline 1.8, was 2.1 on 12/16/05) LFTs wnl Labs (10/20/05): 24 hr urine collection (1375 ml): uric acid 408

Horizontal lucency seen through the navicular bone on one view only. Given the presence of soft tissue swelling dorsally, fracture cannot entirely be excluded. Assessment 64 yo M with HIV on HAART, acute on chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine 2.8 over baseline 1.8) thought to be due to either HIV nephropathy or hypertensive nephrosclerosis, elevated serum uric acid and polyarticular gout, now resolved gout flare in the L foot, being maintained on colchicine 0.6 mg daily for prophylaxis and recently increased to allopurinol 100 mg po daily. Avoiding NSAIDs because of nephrotoxicity. Recommend: 1. Discontinue colchicine as prophylaxis therapy as he has had no gout flare recurrences and is tolerating the allopurinol. 2. Continue allopurinol at 100 mg po daily. If well-tolerated (no evidence of skin rash, myopathy so far), may need to titrate up allopurinol slowly (once monthly) to goal uric acid <6. Check CBC and uric acid level today.. 3. Please schedule follow up appt ASAP with Dr. Kkkkkkkkk Dddd (Renal).  Will recheck BUN/creatinine today. 4. RTC 1 month.
