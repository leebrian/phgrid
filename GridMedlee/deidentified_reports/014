GI: Ms. Xxxxx is a 73 y/o woman followed by me since 01 for evaluation of heme(+) stool. Her PMHx was significant for PD. She was noted to have an elevation in her LFT's and a w/u was initiated. (1)Heme(+) stool w/u: Colonoscopy: int hemorrhoids EGD:WNL (2)Elevated LFT w/u: Cryptogenic cirrhosis The focus of her most recent visits has been the evaluation of vague abdominal pain symptoms. She is unable to describe her symptoms in a coherent manner so w/u has been difficult. A F/U ABDCT was recently requested and was notable for: Liver cysts and cirrhosis. At her last visit a gastric emptying study was requested. Data: Gastric emptying study: T 1/2: 135 (mild to moderate prolongation). Between her last visit and today she was briefly admitted to hospital due to what was likely a viral enteritis. Today she continues to report symptoms that include but are not limited to head ache, weakness, blurred vision, dry mouth,GERD type symptoms, abdominal pain, burning urination, rectal discomfort. The current working Dx's have included: (1)Mild gastroparesis (?) PD Dz assoc. This finding does not at all explain her multitude of complaints if any. Given her co-morbidities there are no medical options (reglan and zelnorm are both contraindicated in her case)other than low fat diet. At her last visit, she was set-up for new primary care f/u. laboratories were also requested including U/A. Her labs were not deviated from baseline, NH4 was WNL, and there was no evidence of UTI.  She was seen in gen Med and a PPI was started. My office notes show though that she has been on a PPI as recently as early Jan. Meds: Ambien, propranolol, coreg, Carbi/Levodopa, Prilosec,Requip, Docusate RJ Gggggg-Cccccccccccc
