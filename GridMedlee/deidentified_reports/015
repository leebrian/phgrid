Xxxx, Xxxx 9999999 Oncology Clinic 3/6/06 83M with rectal cancer presenting 9/04 with abdominal pain and pneumoperitoneum on plain film. Taken emergently to OR where he was found to have perforated sigmoid colon. He underwent resection of sigmoid colon and colostomy formation; the abdomen was left open. Path showed perforation of sigmoid colon with abscess formation. Post-op course complicated by poor nutrition, fevers and concern for cholecystitis (cholecystectomy not done due to comorbidities) also a fib with RVR. Discharged to NH in Oct 2004 with VAC dressing in place. The VAC was discontinued in December 2004, however, he still has an open abdominal wound and gets daily dressing changes. Seen in surgery clinic in Jan 2005 and colonoscopy was done which showed a circumferential nearly obstructing tumor at 6cm in the distal rectum. Path showed adenocarcinoma. Referred to onc clinic in early Feb. At that time was complaining of some pain at his surgical site and occasionally in lower back. Had poor appetite and 30lb weight loss since Oct 2004. At that time his surgical wound was not healed, still had a 5x3cm open area of pink granulation tissue and was getting daily dressing changes. He was not felt to be a candidate for chemotherapy or XRT due to the open wounds. Since then he has been followed intermittently in oncology clinic and has had gradual improvement in his performance status. He is now living at home and spends his day at a senior center. Scans in 11/05 showed possible enlargement of perihepatic fluid collection. Sent to surgery clinic, and they set up U/S guided aspiration of fluid. This was attempted on 2/6/06; however, no fluid was localized for drainage. He had repeat CT scans last week and now comes in for f/u. He reports occ abd pain mainly RUQ, worsens with movement, especially moving from lying down to sitting or standing. Some rectal discharge but nonbloody. Occasional rectal pain but not severe. Appetite is good. No N/V. No change in ostomy output. Still having problems with getting enough supplies for his stomas. No fevers or chills. Started Xeloda last week, will finish March 15.  Tolerating fairly well.  Some increase ostomy output.  No fevers.  Dry skin on hands but no rash.

EXAM: 98 122/60 wt. 116# (from 106) GEN: thin, elderly man, walks with walker, NAD HEENT: anicteric, OP clear, no LAD CV: RRR CHEST: CTAB ABD: soft, NTND, LLQ ostomy with brown stool in bag, BS present, midline wound with thin pink granulation tissue intact, no drainage EXT: trace edema bilateral LE Lab: 3/6  wbc 12, hgb 12.9, plt 259,  78N 2/27/06 wbc 14, hgb 13, plt 323, Diff 77N Cr 0.5, AlkP 269 otherwise LFTs nl CEA 6.5 1/23 CEA 7.1 11/14/05 wbc 15, hgb 12, plt 394 Cr 0.6, LFTs normal except AlkP 193 CEA 5.6 1/5/05 CEA 5.8 CT a/p 2/18/06: Liver parenchyma normal. Complex perihepatic fluid collection along lateral aspect of R hepatic lobe, decreased in size since prior CT. Lung bases show nodular pleural thickening present on the prior CT. A left colectomy and ileostomy are again noted. Inflammatory changes in the mesentery of the left anterior pelvis are unchanged from the prior CT and likely represent postsurgical changes. There is no abnormal pelvic lymphadenopathy. The bowel is normal in caliber with no evidence of obstruction. There are no hernias. CT chest 11/23/05: small right pleural effusion has increased when compared to March 2005 scan. Previously seen small irregular nodule in RLL has increased in size and is now bilobed measuring 3.7x2.4cm. All bronchi are patent. No lymphadenopathy. CT a/p 11/23/05: Enhancing rim of soft tissue extending along lateral and posterior margin of R hepatic lobe has slightly increased in size since prior study. Soft tissue enhances peripherally with heterogeneous solid and cystic components. Liver parenchyma enhances normally without liver masses. No lymphadenopathy. Left colostomy noted. Inflammatory tissue in left anterior pelvis seen on prior CT is markedly decreased in size and prominence. Bowel is normal in caliber. No free air. Midline pelvic wall defect which contains air and a small amount of oral contrast suggesting EC fistula. CT a/p 7/12/05: A 6.6 x 2.5 cm heterogeneously enhancing loculated fluid collection is again noted abutting compressing the lateral right hepatic lobe which is unchanged from the prior study. This collection demonstrates internal septations and an enhancing wall consistent with an abscess. The liver parenchyma demonstrates normal homogeneous enhancement with no focal masses. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation and there is normal enhancement of the portal vein and hepatic veins. A large gallstone is again noted. The spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands are normal in size and configuration. Both kidneys show normal symmetric enhancement with no renal masses or hydronephrosis. There is no abnormal abdominal lymphadenopathy and the bones are normal with no lytic or blastic lesions. A 5.2 x 3.7 cm phlegmonous mass is again noted in the left anterior pelvis which encases the sigmoid colon and multiple small bowel loops which appears more prominent compared to the prior CT. There is a communicating tract in the left anterior pelvic wall with passage of oral contrast from the sigmoid colon through a defect in the anterior pelvic wall into an external colostomy bag. There are no distended bowel loops to suggest obstruction. The appendix appears normal. There are no loculated fluid collections in the pelvis to suggest an abscess. There is no free fluid, free intraperitoneal air or extraluminal oral contrast. There are no hernias. A/P: 83M with locally advanced rectal cancer s/p ex lap and colostomy in 9/04 for perforated diverticulum. He has had a slow recovery but is now doing fairly well. He has had a chronic perihepatic complex fluid collection; however, this was unable to be drained via ultrasound guidance because no fluid component was localized. -Continue palliative chemotherapy with Xeloda 750mg/m2 bid x 14 days. (1000mg qam and 1500mg qpm.) -Has Zofran prn nausea but hasn't had to take. -Imodium prn diarrhea. -Again reviewed toxicities with pt and his home attendant including  need to monitor for N/V, diarrhea, fevers, hand-foot syndrome and other side effects. -Chest CT scheduled for Tuesday 3/21. -RTC 3/20.
